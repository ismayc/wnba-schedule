//
// Nothing rolls over on its own — the refresh follows the committed teams.js season —
// so this tells us the day the new schedule lands and the rollover becomes a decision
// rather than a discovery. Ported from the-nba-schedule's watch after its 2026-27
// release; the league specifics below were re-derived for the WNBA, not copied.
//
// A WNBA season is named for its ONLY calendar year: season=2027 plays May–Oct 2027.
// The target defaults to the season AFTER the committed one, so the watch can never
// re-detect the season the site already shows.
//
// Node built-ins only, like every script here, so CI can run it on a bare checkout.
//
//   node scripts/check-new-season.mjs [--season 2027]
//
// Exit 0 always — "not yet" is a normal answer, not a failure. The workflow reads the
// `released` line from stdout rather than an exit code.
